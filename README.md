# Big-Five

Data collected from [there](https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/). 
Dataset: IPIP-FFM-data-8Nov2018.zip, containing 1,015,342 data.
Data created from [this website](http://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/). 

In my opinion, this is a largely insufficient test battery, containing
only 50 items, whilst the IPIP-NEO contains up to 300 items. But, well, I'm not an expert :)
